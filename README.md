# LicensePlateDetectorAndRecognizer

## A Simple License plate detector:

Using Yolov7 for plate detection and an CNN-LSTM based NeuralNetwork to recognize plate number.

To use, download YOLO trained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iR-jNp7ecDzuhAoCx5Q5shGf6tScQpiT?usp=sharing) and add it in ObjectDetector -> YOLOv7 -> yolov7
and download OCR weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iR-jNp7ecDzuhAoCx5Q5shGf6tScQpiT?usp=sharing) and add to Assets. "DONT FORGET TO CHANGE CONFIGs"

Although this model is not a perfect one but it is a good excesice for both object detection and OCR.

## EXAMPLE

<img src="Cars183.png" alt="MarineGEO circle logo" style="height: 640px; width:640px;"/>

prediction: "BRIT0001"
